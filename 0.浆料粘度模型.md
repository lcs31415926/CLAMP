### Abstract

In a catalyst ink for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) some of the ionomer is adsorbed on the carbon-supported Pt catalyst (Pt/C), which enhances the ink stability, while the rest is dispersed in the solvent as a nonadsorbed ionomer. To clarify the effect of nonadsorbed ionomer on the ink viscosity, the amount of nonadsorbed ionomer in the catalyst ink was eval uated by small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS). At highshear viscosity, the nonadsorbed ionomer was found to act as ionomer solution described by the Huggins equation. Moreover, comparison with the CV-SANS results revealed that the conventional filtration method overestimates the amount of nonadsorbed ionomer in a catalyst ink.

### 1. Introduction

Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) are promising power sources for automobiles.As a vital component for PEFCs, the porous catalyst layer (CL) is typically fabricated from a carbonsupported Pt catalyst (Pt/C) covered with a perfluoro-sulfonic acid ionomer. The ionomer layer, which has a thickness of approximately 10nm provides good proton conductivity. However,if the cathode CL is homogeneously covered with an ionomer layer the catalyst will show a lower oxygen transport capacity and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, as oxygen reacts with the proton at the interface between the ionomer layer and the catalyst.² Therefore, a rational design of ionomer distribution in a CL is desired for a higherperformance PEFC As CLs are fabricated using a colloidal catalyst ink that con

tains $\Pr/C$ particles and ionomers in a water/alcohol mixture as

a dispersion medium (DM), the CL microstructure depends on the structure of the catalyst ink. The structure of a typical catalyst ink is illustrated in Figure 1. The addition of the ionomer to the catalyst ink reduces the size and enhances the stability of $Pt/C$ aggregate particles,35 reduces ink viscosity,5,6 and allows the formation of a smooth CL without cracks, because some ionomer adsorbed onto the Pt/C particles weakens the interaction between $\Pr/C$ particles.4,5 By contrast, there are few reports on the role of the non-

adsorbed ionomer in the catalyst ink. Some of the nonadsorbed ionomer is believed to self-aggregate during the drying process and the presence of self-organizing ionomers provides stress concentrations that result in the formation of cracks. In fact, catalyst inks with weak interactions between the ionomer and $\Pr/C$ particles induce the formation of cracks in the CL.8 Moreover, the self-organizing ionomers in a CL are considered to affect the gas permeability and/or ORR activity.9-11 There

fore, adsorbed and nonadsorbed ionomers have distinct roles in a catalyst ink. However, many aspects of the role of the nonadsorbed ionomer remain unclear, especially with respect to rheological behavior.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is an effective method for the structural analysis of polymers.Yamaguchi et al. have investigated the structure of Nafion? in both water/ethanol and water/1-propanol mixtures.12 However, catalyst inks, which contain $\Pr/C$ particles and ionomers, cannot be analyzed by a simple SAXS technique because the scattering intensity is the sum of each component in the catalyst ink. For such multi component material, neutrons are a powerful probe because they are sensitive to light elements such as hydrogen and allow the scattering length density (SLD) to be controlled by varying the hydrogen/deuterium ratio of the DM. Thus, it is possible to obtain only the scattering intensity of Nafion? by performing experiments with carbon contrast matching.13 Furthermore, contrast-variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) is a powerful technique for investigating the structure of multicomponent materials because it allows the total scattering intensity function to be decomposed into partial scattering functions by simply tuning the SLD. In previous studies, CV. SANS helped reveal the “real” catalyst $ink^{14}$ and study the effect of the drying process and Pt loadingl on the ionomer adsorption onto a $\Pr/C$ particle in a catalyst ink. In this study, we applied the CV-SANS technique to evaluate the amounts of nonadsorbed ionomer in a catalyst ink.Furthermore, the origin of high-shear viscosity in a catalyst ink was discussed from the viewpoint of the nonadsorbed ionomer. Finally, we compared a conventional filtration method, which separates $Pt/C$ particles covered with an ionomer layer from the nonadsorbed ionomer using a syringe filter, with the CV-SANS method. The volume fractions of nonadsorbed ionomer obtained by these two methods were consistent qualitatively; however there were slight quantitative differences in the values, which were discussed based on the differences in these methods. 2.Experimental

2.1 Sample Preparation.A series of catalyst inks was pre pared using $\Pr/C$ particles (TEC10V30E, Tanaka Kikinzoku) and Nafion ionomer dispersion (D2020, Chemours). These starting materials were dispersed in a water/alcohol mixture and then sonicated for $3min$ . In this study, the ionomer/carbon weight ratio (I/C) was set to 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1.00. The volume fraction of each component is summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. Changing the I/C also caused the ratio of ethanol to 1-propanol in the DM to change (Table 2). However, this difference could be ignored in our study as long as the water/ alcohol ratio remained the same, as the differences in the rela tive dielectric constants6 and surface tension'7 of the water/ alcohol mixtures are negligible (Table 3).

Table 1. Specifications of each catalyst ink.

For contrast variation, the SLD (SLD1- 4=2.C ,3.3,4.0, and $4.8\times10^{10}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ was tuned by varying the $H/D$ ratio using $D_20$ and $\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{D}_{5}$OD .Furthermore, we prepared a 2vol$.\%$ Nafion ionomer solution with the same water/alcohol ratio in the solvent as for the catalyst ink. 2.2 SANS Measurements.The SANS measurements were

performed using an NGB $10m$ SANS instrument at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The wavelength of the incident neutron beam was 10Å and the scattered neutrons were collected using a two-dimensional detector. Two sample-todetector distances, 1.2 and $5.2m$ , enabled us to cover momen tum transfers $(Q=4\pi$sin$\theta/\lambda$ ,where $\lambda$ and $2\theta$ are the wave length of an incident neutron beam and scattering angle, respectively) ranging from 0.004 to 0.3 $\hat{\mathrm{A} } ^{- 1}$ . The samples were loaded into a titanium cell with a $1mm$ gap between the two quartz windows. The SANS experiments were carried out at $25°C$ .The scattering data were reduced by the direct-beam method to an absolute scale using IGOR Pro reduction macros.18 Incoherent scattering was subtracted from each data set.The obtained scattering functions were decomposed into three partial scatter ing functions: $S_{\mathrm{CC}}(Q)$ $S_{\mathrm{pp}}(Q)$ , and $S_{\mathrm{CP}}(Q)$ $S_{\mathrm{CC}}(Q)$ and $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ represent the self-correlation of carbon and ionomer, respectively. $S_{\mathrm{CP}}(Q)$ denotes the cross-correlation of carbon and ionomer. A singular value decomposition method19 was applied to the datasets (SLD14) in order to obtain partial scattering functions. The procedure for singular value decomposition is described in supporting information. SANS functions were reconstructed from the obtained three partial scattering func tions and SLD parameters of the components to validate the decomposition process (Supporting information in detail) 2.3 Characterization by Filtration Methods.As shown

in Figure 2, ionomer-covered $\Pr/C$ particles in a catalyst ink were removed using a syringe filter.? The residual solution was transferred into a weighing bottle, which was then heated at $80°C$ overnight. The bottle was weighed before and after the heat treatment. The volume fraction of nonadsorbed ionomer $(\phi_{\text{Filter}})$ in the catalyst ink is given by the following equation.

Here, $N$ is the weight of the residual solution (before heat treatment), $H$ is the solid content (after heat treatment), and $MI$ and $M_{\mathrm{DM}}$ are the ionomer and DM densities, respectively. In this study, $M_{I}$ and $M_{\mathrm{DM}}$ were set to 2.0 and 0.85 g$\cdot \mathrmcm^{- 3}$ , respectively. $M_{\mathrm{DM}}$ was calculated from the composition of the DM. Note that the error owing to the breakdown of volume additivity was negligible in our case 2.4 Rheological Measurements.Rheological experiments

were performed using a rheometer (MCR301,Anton Paar GmbH) with a cone plate $(50mm$ diameter, $1^{\circ}$ cone angle, and 0.101mm gap). A typical rheological measurement protocol was as follows. The sample was placed in a sample holder at $25°C$ The dependence of the steady flow viscosity on the shear rate was measured in the range of 0.01-1000 $\mathrm{s} ^{- 1}$ .To ensure reproducibility, replicate measurements were obtained and the second dataset was used.

### 3.Results and Discussion

3.1 SANS Profiles in Catalyst Inks.The SANS profiles of each catalyst ink sample at various SLDs (SLD1-4) are displayed in Figure 3. A singular value decomposition method was applied to the date set to obtain partial scattering functions. The reconstructed SANS functions reproduce the experimental data well, confirming the success of the decomposition process (Figure 4). Three partial scattering functions, $S_{\mathrm{CC}}(Q)$ ， $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ ,，and

$S_{\mathrm{CP}}(Q)$ , are shown in Figure 5. The scattering intensities of $S_{\mathrm{CC}}(Q)$ and $S_{\mathrm{CP}}(Q)$ decrease monotonically, whereas the profiles of $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ have a peak around $Q\sim 0. 0\dot{4}$ $\dot{\mathrm{\r {A}} } ^{- 1}$ . In the following paragraph, we discuss these partial structure functions individually.

Figure 6.Structural evolution of adsorbed ionomer on a Pt/C aggregate in a catalyst ink by increase of I/C.

The $S_{\mathrm{CC}}(Q)$ functions of all the catalyst inks overlap, indicating that the size of the secondary carbon particles (i.e., carbon aggregates) is independent of the ionomer content (Figure 5a). This tendency is in agreement with previous reports based on dynamic light scattering.4 However, in a catalyst ink similar to our system, rheological measurements indicated that agglomeration of the carbon aggregates decreased at higher ionomer contents.6 Ultra-small-angle neutron scattering measurements are required for structural characterization of carbon agglomerates up to several microns in size,13 and a dis cussion of these structures is beyond the scope of this study. In contrast to $S_{\mathrm{CC}}(Q)$ $S_{\mathrm{CP}}(Q)$ and $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ are sensitive to I/C

(Figure 5b, c). The intensities of $S_{\mathrm{CP}}(Q)$ and $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ in the low- $\ell$ region $( Q< 0. 03$ ${\mathrm{A} }^{- 1}$ ) increased from 0.25 I/C to 0.50 I/C and then were almost constant up to 1.00 1/C . Shibayama et al.14 explained that the intensities of $S_{\mathrm{CP}}(Q)$ and $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ in the low $\cdot Q$ region depends on the density and thickness of adsorbed ionomer layer. To discuss the density and thickness of adsorbed ionomer

layer quantitatively, we fitted three partial scattering functions using a core-shell modell4 (see supporting information in detail). As $I/C$ increases, the density of the ionomer layer increases from 0.12 at 0.25 I/C to 0.21 at 1.00 I/C ,while the thickness was almost constant for all I/C ratios (Figure S2). Earlier studies found that ionomer adsorption follows the Langmuir isotherm and the maximum surface coverage of the primary adsorption was estimated to be $4.62\times10^{-4}$g/m$^2$ in a catalyst ink similar to our system.20 Since the surface coverage is calculated to be $3.0\times10^{-4}$g/m$^2$ for our catalyst ink of 1.0 I/C using obtained fitting parameters, it is suggested that ionomer adsorption follows the Langmuir isotherm for the evaluated range of I/C. Therefore,we concluded that ionomers adsorb as a monolayer onto the Pt/C aggregates in a catalyst ink at least until $1.01/C$ .A possible illustration of the catalyst ink is shown in Figure 6. For $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ , an upturn is observed in the high- $Q$ region $(Q>$

0.03 ${\r {A}}^{- 1})$ (Figure 5b). Shibayama et al.14 explained that $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ for a catalyst ink is the sum of the adsorbed ionomer function dominant in the low. $\cdot Q$ region and the nonadsorbed ionomer function dominant in the high $\cdot Q$ region. Therefore, the upturn indicated an increase of nonadsorbed ionomer in the catalyst ink with increasing I/C. This is an expected result because there is a limitation to ionomer adsorption on the $\Pr/C$ particles. It is worth noting that the shoulder in $S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)$ appears near $Q\sim$ 0.04 $\r {A}^{- 1}$ in the catalyst inks. This trend is a so-called “ionomer

In addition, the profiles of ionomer solution show the crossove $Q^{-2}$ to $Q^{-4}$ at $Q= 0. 10$ ${\check{A} }^{- 1}$ . The origin of $Q^{-2}$ could beregard ed as the fractal dimension of the bending bundle-like aggreBates" and theroto en $Q$ int ndicaies t 0.10 ${\r {A}}^{- 1}$ mito $Q^{-4}$ dependence could be described by Porod’s law.24 At the Porod region, the scattering intensity depends on the specific surface defined as the total surface area of interface over the total vol ume ratio.2 For bundles, the specific surface is equal to $2\varphi/R$ where $\varphi$ and $R$ are the volume fraction and the radius of bundles Therefore, the scattering intensity at the Porod region depends on the volume fraction of bundles,if the radius of bundles is independent to the volume fraction. (see supporting information in detail). For Nafion° ionomer, the validity of assumption has been confirmed by SANS experiments.26 Thereby, the volume fraction of nonadsorbed ionomer could be evaluated as follows
$$S_{\mathrm{PP}}(Q)=\frac{\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}}{\phi_{D}}\:D(Q)\:\mathrm{(at~the~Porod~region)}$$

Here, $D(Q)$ denotes the scattering function of the ionomer solution, and $\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ and $\phi_{D}$ are the volume fractions of the nonadsorbed ionomer and the ionomer solution, respectively

Figure 9.Dependence of the high-shear viscosity (10000 $\mathrm{s} ^{- 1})$ on $\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ for a catalyst ink. The dashed line represents the fitting curve obtained using the Huggins equation

The volume fraction of nonadsorbed ionomer calculated using eq (2) is displayed in Figure 8, together with the total ionomer volume fraction, $\phi_{\mathrm{I}}$ , in the samples. Although $\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ increased at higher I/C values, $\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ and $\phi_1$ were not equal across the I/C range,indicating the presence of adsorbed ionomer in the catalyst ink. 3.2 Rheology of a Catalyst Ink.We attempted to quantify

the effect of the nonadsorbed ionomer on the ink viscosity.At a high-shear rate $(1000\mathrm{~s}^{-1\times1})$ where the carbon network struc ture breaks down (see Figure S1), the shear viscosity $TI$ of the catalyst ink could be expressed by

$$\eta=\eta_0+\Delta\eta_p+\Delta\eta_i$$

Here, $\eta_{0}$ $\Delta\eta_{p}$ , and $\Delta\eta_{i}$ are the solvent viscosity, the increment of the viscosity by addition of Pt/C particles to solvent,and the increment of the viscosity by the existence of nonadsorbed ionomer in the catalyst ink, respectively. $\Delta\eta_{p}$ depends on the volume fraction of Pt/C particles, $\phi_{\mathrm{Pt/C}}$

$$\Delta\eta_{p}=2.5\eta_{0}\phi_{\mathrm{Pt/C}}$$

In this case, $\phi_{\mathrm{Pt/C}}$ is the same value in all samples (see Table 1). Furthermore, from the Huggins equation,27 $\Delta\eta_{i}$ is described by

$$\Delta\eta_i=\eta_0([\eta]C+k'[\eta]^2C^2)$$

Here, [7], $C$ , and $k^{r}$ represent intrinsic viscosity, ionomer concentration, and Huggins constant, respectively. By substituting eq (4) and (5) into eq (3), we obtain the following equation:

$$\eta=\eta_{0}(1+2.5\phi_{\mathrm{Pt/C}}+[\eta]C+k'[\eta]^{2}C^{2})$$

The high-shear viscosity $(1000\mathrm{~s}^{-1\times})$ was plotted against the ionomer concentration $C_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ (Figure 9). It should be noted that $C_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ was converted to $\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ (see supporting informa tion). $\eta_{0}$ and $[\eta]$ were fixed to be 2.7mPa$\cdot \mathrm{s} ^{28}$ s28 $\mathbf{s}^{28}$ and 1dL/g$^29$ for fitting using eq (6). The fitted parameter was $k^{\prime}=0.70\pm0.03$ and the obtained value was matched with a typical ionomer solution.30 Therefore,it was concluded that the contribution of the nonadsorbed ionomer in the catalyst ink to the ink viscosity is similar to that of an ionomer solution.

the filtration method are summarized in Table 4. For compar ison, $\phi_{\mathrm{l}}$ and $\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ are also displayed. Both $\phi_{\mathrm{Filter}}$ and $\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ show the same qualitative trend, increasing monotonically as I/C increases. However, the $\phi_{\mathrm{Filter}}$ values are larger than the $\phi_{\mathrm{SANS}}$ values across the entire I/C range. This variation may originate from differences in the evalua

tion methods. The SANS measurements are performed in a stationary state, whereas a high shear $( > 10^{5}$ $\mathrm{s} ^{- 1})$ was applied during the filtration method when passing through the syringe filter. The driving force for ionomer adsorption onto a Pt/C particle is physical adsorption via forces such as van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions.15,31 Namely, these interactions are probably insufficient to maintain the original state during filtrations.In fact, it has been observed by neutron reflectometry that a polymer chain adsorbed onto a substrate desorbs abruptly above a certain critical shear rate $( \sim 10^{4}$ $s^{- 1})$ 32 Therefore, it can be concluded that the filtration method overestimates the amount of nonadsorbed ionomer in catalyst ink.

### 4.Conclusion

We evaluated the amount of nonadsorbed ionomer in a catalyst ink by performing CV-SANS measurements. The CV SANS experiments revealed that the nonadsorbed ionomer behaves like an ionomer solution, as described by the Huggins equation,with regards to the viscosity of the catalyst ink Furthermore, comparison of the volume fractions of nonadsorbed ionomer obtained by the filtration method and the CV-SANS measurements confirmed that the filtration method provides the correct qualitative trend. However, the filtration methodwas found to overestimate the amount of nonadsorbed ionomer owing to desorption within the syringe filter. Our findings will provide new guidelines beyond I/C optimization for the rheology of catalyst inks and help us to develop a design concept for the ionomer distribution in CLs.
